### *Ben Ries-Roncalli*
Basic visualization of inequalities in business ownership in the US for the top and bottom five sales industries done for the Decade project, a Seattle-based nonprofit aimed at empowering minority owned businesses.

The data used in this analysis was collected from the 2017 Annual Business Survey and the Census.

The goal of this project was to visualize inequalities in business ownership across America and identifying trends across gender, ethnicity and race in these categories, with the hope that they will help the Decade Project direct potential business owners (especially women and people of color) to some of the more successful business industries.

1. Petroleum/coal products manufac.
2. Hospitals
